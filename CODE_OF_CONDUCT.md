## The Goal

The ultimate goal of BoarBotDevs is to make our players happy. This may be implementing features commonly requested by
players, interacting with our community in a positive way, creating community-driven events and experiences, and much
more.

## The Standards

Our standards are put in place to ensure that our projects remain focused on the community and that all contributors are
held accountable for their actions.

Our standards are:
- Harassment of any degree will not be tolerated. We do not condone discrimination of religion, sex, race, gender, identity, nationality, 
and sexuality.
- Everyone can and should be respected no matter their level of experience or degree of opinion.
- Maintain relevancy in discussions and do not spam.
- Collaboration is a must. Work with other contributors to form solutions.
- Deliver on your commitments. If you make a promise, make sure that promise is followed through.
- Acknowledge the intellectual and creative properties of your peers. Do not steal ideas or pieces of content and claim
them as your own. BoarBot falls under default copyright law and will not tolerate hostile forks.

Examples of breaking each rule includes:
- Bullying or making ill-mannered inappropriate jokes about another person.
- Saying someone is lesser simply because they have less experience than you.
- Creating issues that do not pertain to the code or trolling in official communities.
- Creating a PR and demanding approvals from other contributors instead of asking for review first.
- Promising players that you'll implement a feature, but never taking the time to work on said feature.
- Taking an idea from player, implementing it, and refusing to reference the user the idea came from.

## The Responsibilities

Project maintainers are solely responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards. They also have the right to
make any changes to commits, comments, code, issues, and other contributions. They also have the right to ban any
contributors for violating standards.

Contributors are expected to follow the standards to a T, both within their own work, verifying the work of others, and
within community communications.

## The Scope

This CoC applies to all projects and official communities associated with BoarBotDevs and any forks of BoarBot.

## The Enforcement

Any violation of this CoC should be reported directly to project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated solely through the view of this CoC.

Consultation of players and other important members of our community may occur to verify any violations. There's always
gray areas in rules, and we believe the community generally will have the correct opinion.

Below is a list of actions that may be taken in the case of a violation.

### Edit

If your message is difficult to understand or could be misconstrued, it may be edited.

### Deletion

If your message is irrelevant, it may be deleted and a warning will be issued.

### Mute

Mutes will not be issued. In the case where a mute may be applicable, a ban will be issued instead.

### Ban

If you've had several messages deleted or a message breaks the CoC, you may be banned. All bans are permanent unless
a convincing appeal is made.
